## Customer Segmentation using k-means clustering
A technique to divide the customers based on their purchase history, gender, age, interest, etc. It is useful to get this information so that the store can get help in personalize marketing and provide customers with relevant deals.

First step involved in this poject is exploring and visualizing the data set.

## Data Visualizing using Histogram:
When exploring a dataset, you’ll often want to get a quick understanding of the distribution of certain numerical variables within it.
 A common way of visualizing the distribution of a single numerical variable is by using a histogram. 
A histogram divides the values within a numerical variable into “bins”, and counts the number of observations that fall into each bin.
 By visualizing these binned counts in a columnar fashion, we can obtain a very immediate and intuitive sense of the distribution of values within a variable.
